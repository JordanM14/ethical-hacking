# Ethical Hacking

## Objective
The client hired a consultant to install and configure a new server in their internal network to support production and operations. You are tasked with determining the vulnerabilities of the new Production server and provide specific examples of how any vulnerabilities could be exploited. You are also asked to perform the same service on the Web Server in their DMZ.


### Skills Learned

- understanding the scoring of CVE exploits
- Proper procedures and techniques for pentesting
- basic fudamentals of ethical hacking
- Enumerate Vulnerabilities
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- metasploit 
- virtualbox
- linux
- terminal

## Project task
- Install the supplied Production server VM into the Trusted network in VirtualBox
- Use tools within Kali Linux to enumerate all vulnerabilities on the Production server. Research the severity of the vulnerabilities using CVE numbers
- Use tools within Kali Linux to enumerate all vulnerabilities on the Web server. Research the severity of the vulnerabilities using CVE numbers
- Exploit at least 2 of the vulnerabilities you found on the Production server, one of which must give you root access to the server
- Exploit at least 2 of the vulnerabilities you found on the Web server, one of which must give you root access to the server. These should be different vulnerabilities than you found on the production server
- Create your own “backdoor” account on the Production server that has root permissions
- Look for any interesting files on the Production and Web servers
- Provide recommendations to improve server security
